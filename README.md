This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/(site)/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses `next/font/local` to load Quicksand from `src/app/fonts/` (no network fetch during build).

## Builds

The build uses Webpack to avoid Turbopack restrictions in sandboxed environments:

```bash
npm run build
```

For offline/sandbox builds (no outbound network to Sanity), use:

```bash
npm run build:offline
```

This sets `SANITY_OFFLINE=1` and uses a safe fallback payload for Sanity data during prerendering.
